          <h4>
            Hello, my name is <em>Kristina Moran</em> and I live on Long Island,
            NY.
          </h4>
          <p>
            I have a Bachelor's degree in Business Management with a focus in
            Marketing. I was in the Mental Health field with a focus on
            Addiction Treatment for 17 years. In high school I started as a file
            clerk at a local treatment center and rose to become Director of
            Intake. I decided to take a position at another treatment center in
            their Marketing department where I had to create my own leads and
            follow through until the clients were accepted into the program. I
            became Director of Marketing and started and led our Intern program.
            In 2018 I decided to leave the Mental Health field to become my
            family's chief home officer and take care of my young children.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now ready to work outside the home and change to a field where
            changes can be seen in measurable ways. I want to use my creativity
            to create things in a digital landscape and programming is how I am
            choosing to do so. I am currently studying at MIT xPRO to become a
            full stack programmer using the mern stack. I am currently studying
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I look forward to growing my skills,
            portfolio, and my network. If you'd like to get in touch with me
            please navigate to my Contact Me page. I look forward to connecting
            with you.
